HOW DID I DO THIS?
It was actually pretty easy - I just compiled libreadline like normal, and installed it into a fake root directory. Then, I cross compiled scanmem using that fake root and the android NDK toolchain.

HOW DO I INSTALL THIS?
Copy the contents of bin/ into your device's /system/bin, and copy the contents of lib/ into /system/lib. Just note: to run scanmem, root is required to be able to modify other processes' memory. If someone would like to release an app to simplify the installing process, feel completely free to (assuming the original scanmem license permits it). I'd quite like to know about it though, so just shoot me a message at http://reddit.com/u/crazym4n or @Aearnus

HOW DO I USE THIS?
Busybox method:
Download a terminal emulator and busybox on the play store. Use the terminal emulator to run `ps` and `grep` to search for the process you want to modify. Note down the PID of the process (second column), and run the `scanmem` command. Follow the on-screen instructions for scanmem, and type `help` if you get lost.
ADB method:
Make sure your Android can connect to a computer through ADB, and repeat the above steps, with the exception of using the command `adb shell` on your computer instead of downloading a terminal emulator.

Have fun!
